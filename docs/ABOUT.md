a very simple taxi app. two views, rider and driver. drivers show on map to users,
users can call drivers to drive them to a specific location. fee is paid with eth.
drivers sit and wait for jobs and accept and get guided to user location, then once
picked up taken to destination

#### deployment:

will have a "simulation" mode with fake drivers roaming around the user.
riders don't need accounts. we'll do the simulation/deployed version to run
in london rather than user's browser location.

all eth payments (if made) will go to me lol. although try not to push it, show
a video of it working but let people do it if they really want to.
